# Cause-Effect-App

**Description:**
The provided code consists of an HTML file (`index.html`), a CSS file (`styles.css`), and a JavaScript file (`script.js`). The purpose of the code is to create a web page that displays a list of fake persons with their names. When a person's name is clicked or hovered over, their address, phone number, and birthday details are displayed on the page. The layout includes a header, a person list, and a footer.

**Usage:**
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the web page.
2. Click or hover over a person's name in the list to see their details.
3. The footer contains a disclaimer about the fake nature of the persons listed.

**Libraries Required:**
The code uses the following external libraries:
- **Material Icons:** The Material Icons font is included from Google Fonts for icon styling.
  ```html
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Material+Icons" rel="stylesheet">
  ```
- **Google Fonts:** The code includes multiple Google Fonts for styling the text throughout the page.
  ```html
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Lato:ital,wght@1,100&family=Poppins:wght@400;500;600;700;800&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Karla:wght@400;600&family=Lato:ital,wght@1,100&family=Poppins:wght@400;500;600;700;800&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
  ```

**Additional Information:**
- The styling is defined in the `styles.css` file, providing a clean and responsive design.
- The JavaScript in `script.js` generates a list of persons dynamically and attaches event listeners to each person's name to display their details when clicked or hovered over.
- The footer is fixed at the bottom of the page and contains a disclaimer about the fictional nature of the persons listed.
- The script uses test data in the form of an array of persons (`persons`) to demonstrate functionality.

**Roadmap:**

The page was developed for JavaScript practice, so there's a lot of room for improvement! Feel free to play around!

**Project Status:**

Currently, the project is completed.
